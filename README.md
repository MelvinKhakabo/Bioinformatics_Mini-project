TNF Gene Sequence Analysis

Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive sequence analysis of the human TNF gene. The analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools to explore the gene's structure, function, and regulation. The steps involved in this analysis include downloading the sequence, translating it, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), analyzing sequence composition, identifying transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding or non-coding regions, and converting sequence file formats.

Discussion and Future Directions
This project provides valuable insights into the structure, function, and regulation of the TNF gene. The identification of multiple ORFs, transcription factor binding sites, and functional motifs suggests that the TNF gene plays a critical role in various biological processes, particularly in immune responses. Future research could focus on experimental validation of these findings and exploring the gene's role in different populations to better understand its involvement in disease susceptibility.
